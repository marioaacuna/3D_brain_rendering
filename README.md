# 3D_brain_rendering
Small project on rendering a brain 3d structure where the implantation sites (lenses so far) are also rendered
This makes use of the BrainMesh repo from https://github.com/Yaoyao-Hao/BrainMesh
This is just a simple transformation from the Paxinos coordinates to the Allen coordinates, which then are used as inputs for creating a structure to place on the rendered 3D brain
